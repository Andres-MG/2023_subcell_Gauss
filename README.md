[![arXiv:2211.05066](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2211.05066-green?style=flat-square)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05066)

This repository contains code and instructions to reproduce the results reported in the article

> A flux differencing formulation with Gauss nodes

The instructions to perform the analysis of the error and convergence shown in figure 2 are in
`flou_tests/`, and `fluxo_tests/` contains the instructions to compute the Sedov blast case shown
in figure 3.
