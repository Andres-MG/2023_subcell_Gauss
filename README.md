This repository contains code and instructions to reproduce the results reported in the article

> A flux differencing formulation with Gauss nodes

The instructions to perform the analysis of the error and convergence shown in figure 2 are in
`flou_tests/`, and `fluxo_tests/` contains the instructions to compute the Sedov blast case shown
in figure 3.
